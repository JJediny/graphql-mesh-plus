*This library is still in development and may have breaking changes along the way.*

GraphQL Mesh Plus is a plugin-based framework in nodejs that allows you to compose a graphql schema declaratively in a yaml file. It is heavily inspired by [GraphQL Mesh](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-mesh) and offers much of the same functionality, but it additionally allows you to write your own plugins with arbitrary configurations.
